# Arduino_Calculator

The project is a calculator created using the Arduino UNO platform. In order to perform calculations, a command should be sent via UART in the form, for example: 2 + 4. The serial port listens for the data and interprets it upon detection. The simulation was performed on the ThinkerCAD platform.
